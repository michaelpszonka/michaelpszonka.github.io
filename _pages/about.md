Hi there. ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Full Stack Developer primarily working in Java , Kotlin and Python on the server side with some experience building apps in NodeJS and Python as well. On the front end I primarily work in ReactJS with some knowledge of Angular.

Currently, I'm an engineer at **[@Workiva](https://www.workiva.com/)** and previously **[@Express Scripts](https://www.express-scripts.com/)**.  I have a Masters in Computer Science from **[@Stevens](https://www.stevens.edu/)** and a Bachelors in Finance from **[@Rutgers](https://www.rutgers.edu/)**.  I'm also working on a Masters in Data Science at the University of Texas because why not U+1F937
